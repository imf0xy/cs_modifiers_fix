# cs_modifiers_fix
A fix for Payday 2 Crime Spree modifiers

After installing this mod, you need to start a new Crime Spree.
For this mod to work properly, both host and client need to have it installed.
If only the host has the mod installed, he will still be able to create higher crime spree lobbies then without the mod. Enemy health and dmg will also be correct for the host. However, enemy health and dmg will only be 1/5 of what they should be for the client.
If only the client installed the mod, but the host didn't, enemy health and dmg will be five times of what they should be for the client.
This mod works fine for up to at least 10 million Crime Spree.
Only BLT 2.0 is required to run this mod.
